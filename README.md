# LakeEwok for Wordpress

## Introduction

An outdated Wordpress 4.7 theme. It is very probably unusable with modern Wordpress, and even if you can install it : be clever, don't ðŸ˜‰.

I built it years ago to learn the basics of Wordpress dev. I even used it on my own blog (you won't find (I hope)).

It is currently discontinued.

## Demo

You can access a live demo of the front-end at [lakeewok.arnaud.cool](https://lakeewok.arnaud.cool) (mockup). For obvious security reasons, I refuse to install it on a wordpress.
